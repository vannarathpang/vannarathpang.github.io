      <h3>Hey! My name is <i>Vannarath Nathan Pang.</i></h3>
        <p> I'm a <b>computer science</b> major and currently in my senior year of university.
        I'm also an <b>amateur freelance photographer and videographer</b>. I guess you could say that I am a person with many interests.

        <br> Growing up, I've always had a passion for computers. Although it was mainly just playing video games, I've grown to love the process of creating and designing.
        <br>
        It started with <b>graphic designing</b>. I always enjoyed making powerpoints for classes because I could have fun with customizing and designing them to be more visually pleasing, that way my audience wouldn't be so bored listening to me ramble for 15 minutes about stuff they don't care about.

        <br>
        Soon after, I got into <b>video editing</b>. I used to make AMV's which is short for Anime Music Videos. You'd basically just edit random clips from a show to match a song of choice. Sounds pretty lame, but I used to love; actually I still love anime to this day. It was definitely a trend back in the day to make AMVs on YouTube.

        <br>

        After graduating high school, I decided to dive into the world of <b>programming</b>. I'm not going to lie, it was extremely intimidating at first... however, I was assigned my first project; to create any program of my choice. I ended up making a little personality quiz app. To be honest, I had an absolute blast making it. It was so fun to customize and design my own program to my own liking. I hope to be able to design my own video game one day in the future.

        <br>

         I then started to become interested in <b>vlogging</b> as I started traveling. It soon sparked an interest in videography and photography. Having a background in video editing, it was pretty easy to edit my own videos with my own personal footage. It's amazing to be able to portray my own stories through my photos and videos for the world to see.

          <br>
          You name them. I love them all. Since I was a child, I loved playing video games on both consoles and computers; especially those that can be played online, and/or cooperatively.
