HW Assignment 2 --

LINK: http://cs.uml.edu/~vpang or http://cs.uml.edu/~vpang/index.html

Both HTML files and CSS file have been run through validator via Link and Upload.

Description:

So far, I've designed the home/index page and an About Me page. Other links on my webpage don't work as they don't exist yet. 
I used the CSS Crash Course For Beginners on YouTube as a base foundation for my website so some of the code may look similar but I stated that in my files. 
My index page also shows a directory for my Homework. So far, none of the links are active as the assignments have yet to be completed, but will be updated once they are.

The website isn't perfect and some rules are probably used in the wrong way to format but that should be fixed later on in the future!
