I have used both of my Homework Extension Tokens to extend to Friday, 11/27/20.

I was not able to get the tab function to work correctly. For some reason, the CSS wasn't loading for the tabs so it just keeps showing as an UL.
I tried changing the JQuery links that it was being loaded from several different sources to no success. It was really confusing me so I didn't have
time to go further with it or fix it on time. I was able to get it to save tables and tabs... just not showing the actual Tab Widget and not properly displaying them and the tables. Since I didn't get past this issue, I didn't get to work on the removal of tabs.
